-The original layout design for this page has been altered, broken, and frankensteined back together
-Some of it kind of works
-it was a valuable lesson in compartmentalizing the design process
-unfortunately, missing 2 classes and completing 2 challenges that weren't the correct assigned material
  has left me too far behind to finish fixing this page
